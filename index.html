    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Leelanshu Upadhyay, a 15-year-old entrepreneur passionate about innovation, leadership, and real-world problem solving. Based in Pune and studying at Bharati Vidyapeeth University, I’ve always believed that age is no barrier to making a difference. I started exploring entrepreneurship at a young age, driven by a desire to create solutions that can empower students and the world around us.
      <br><br>
      My journey began with small experiments—designing projects, learning coding, understanding branding—and today I’m channeling all that into real digital ideas. I work on startup projects, educational tools, and initiatives that inspire young minds. My approach is simple: observe what people need, design a better way, and put in the effort to build it from scratch.
      <br><br>
      I draw inspiration from brands like Nike, whose commitment to performance, storytelling, and excellence deeply influences the way I design my work and life. Like them, I believe in hustle, purpose, and presenting yourself boldly. Whether it's a science fair project, an online typing challenge, or this personal website, I aim to make everything professional and future-ready.
      <br><br>
      Alongside my ventures, I continue to learn every day—through books, coding challenges, public speaking, and business research. I’m committed to becoming not just a businessperson, but a visionary who adds value to others’ lives. My dream is to launch a tech brand that’s accessible, impactful, and deeply rooted in trust.
      <br><br>
      If you're reading this, know that the journey of entrepreneurship doesn't start when you're older—it starts the moment you dare to think differently.

    <h2>How LegacyLoop Started</h2>
    <p>
   LegacyLoop was born from a powerful idea — to create a platform where young entrepreneurs could showcase their innovation, passion, and personal journey in a compelling digital format. The inspiration came from the gap in the market for youth-centric branding platforms that don't just highlight achievements, but also emphasize values, vision, and legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all began with a 15-year-old visionary who believed that age should never be a barrier to ambition. With a laptop, a love for creativity, and a mission to inspire others, the idea took shape into a website. Initially a personal project, LegacyLoop grew rapidly through feedback, iteration, and a strong sense of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name “LegacyLoop” stands for the unbroken cycle of impact — how today’s actions shape tomorrow’s inspiration. It’s about leaving footprints that spark change and encouraging others to begin their journey. What started as a simple profile site evolved into a beautifully designed brand space with sections for portfolio, story, social presence, and future goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the scenes, the founder learned everything from scratch — coding HTML and CSS, designing responsive layouts, understanding UX/UI principles, and constantly refining every detail to deliver a premium experience. From that process, LegacyLoop became more than just a personal website. It became a movement — a call for young minds to take charge, share their narratives, and represent themselves professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, LegacyLoop is not just a website but a brand philosophy. It represents clarity, style, and substance. It has inspired others to build their own identity with purpose. Whether you are a coder, a designer, an artist, or a dreamer, LegacyLoop is your launchpad to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With plans to expand into a community of like-minded creators and provide resources to build personal brands, the future of LegacyLoop is as bold as its beginnings. And this is just the start of the loop.
